# lake-altimetry-inversions
code for processing and inverting ice-sheet altimetry data over subglacial lakes

This is essentially a fork of agstub/subglacial-inversions with (I) the basal drag perturbation inversion option removed and (2) added notebooks for processing/prepping ICESat-2 data for the inversions and post-processing.
See agstub/subglacial-inversions for a description of the inverse method
